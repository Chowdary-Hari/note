### DESCRIPTION:
The Design TO Cost (DTC) is a web-based application for tracking and managing product cost with cost-related data for a new product development program. Besides tracking the product cost data, the tool also provides for workflow and facilitates collaboration amongst team members working on a program. This manual introduces the features of the tool together with instructions on how to use the tool for managing product cost data. This manual organizes such features into sections that define the various user roles.

### Responsibilities:
- Highly motivated and committed AWS Engineer experienced in Automating, Configuring, and deploying instances on AWS and also familiar with EC2, CloudWatch, Elastic IPs, and managing security groups on AWS.
- Deployed the Java application into web application servers like Apache Tomcat.
- Launching Amazon EC2 Cloud Instances using Amazon Web Services (Linux/Ubuntu) and configuring launched instances with respect to specific applications.
- Create Chef automation tools and builds, and do an overall process improvement to any manual processes.
- Experienced in build and deployment of Java applications onto different environments such as QA, UAT, and Production.
- Virtualized the servers using Docker for test environments and dev-environments needs. Also performed configuration automation using Docker containers.
- Working on AWS Auto Scaling for providing high availability of applications and EC2 instances based on the load of applications by using CloudWatch in AWS.
- EBS Volumes management and working on creating snapshots for backups manually and using scripts.
- Launching Amazon EC2 Cloud Instances using Amazon Web Services (Linux/Ubuntu/RHEL) and configuring launched instances with respect to specific applications.

**Self-Introduction:**

Hi, my name is [Your Name], and I have **three years of experience** as a **DevOps Engineer**. I have hands-on expertise in **Linux, Jenkins, Git, Docker, AWS, Ansible, Terraform, Kubernetes (EKS), ECR, Auto Scaling Groups (ASG), AWS DevOps, and ELK**.

In my role, I focus on making **code dry** and efficient in **Jenkins, Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes**. I have strong experience in **CI/CD pipeline automation** using **Jenkins** and have built multi-environment provisioning setups using **Terraform**.

I have successfully integrated **Git, Jenkins, Ansible, and Terraform** to create **end-to-end automated CI/CD pipelines**, ensuring smooth deployments across different environments like **Dev, QA, Pre-prod, and Prod**. I also work closely with development teams to troubleshoot and resolve build-related issues.

I have extensive experience with **Terraform modules**, leveraging them in different stages of the Jenkins **CD pipeline**. I have also used **Terraform Post-Provisioners** to deploy applications on **EC2 instances**.

One of my major projects involved **migrating mutable infrastructure** to **AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**, making the infrastructure more scalable and manageable. Additionally, I have implemented **monitoring dashboards** using **ELK** to track **Traffic, Latency, Errors, and Saturation (TLES) metrics** for the **SRE team**, as well as **EC2 analytics dashboards** for cost savings.

As part of **AWS automation tasks**, I have worked on multiple AWS accounts, handling tasks like:
- Listing **drifted CloudFormation stacks** using Python and exporting them to CSV.
- Identifying **unutilized AWS resources** and generating reports.
- Upgrading deprecated **Lambda functions** from **Python 2.7 to 3.9**.
- Automating **AWS resource tagging** using Python.
- Extracting **CloudWatch datasets** like **CPU, Network In, and Network Out** over different time ranges (10 days, 20 days, 30 days, etc.).

Overall, I am passionate about automation, cloud infrastructure, and optimizing DevOps workflows to improve efficiency and scalability.
