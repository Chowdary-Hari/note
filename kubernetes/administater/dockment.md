10. **Support & Documentation** â€“ Provide technical support and maintain proper documentation.

### **Responsibilities of a Kubernetes Administrator**
1. **Deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters** using tools like `kubeadm`, `kops`, or managed services (EKS, AKS, GKE).
2. **Configure and manage Kubernetes networking** using CNI (Container Network Interface) plugins like Flannel, Calico, or Cilium.
3. **Implement security best practices**, including RBAC, network policies, and secret management.
4. **Manage containerized applications** by deploying Pods, Services, Deployments, and StatefulSets.
5. **Monitor system health** using tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK Stack.
6. **Handle storage management** using Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs).
7. **Ensure high availability and disaster recovery** by configuring multiple master nodes and backup solutions.
8. **Optimize Kubernetes cluster resources** by tuning CPU, memory requests, and limits.
9. **Manage ingress and load balancing** with tools like NGINX Ingress Controller or Traefik.
10. **Keep up with Kubernetes updates** and apply necessary patches to keep clusters secure and efficient.
